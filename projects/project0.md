# Project 0

## Overview
The objective of the first project is to gain experience working with the [Python](https://www.python.org){:target="_blank"} scripting languange and the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org){:target="_blank"} machine learning framework using the [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/){:target="_blank"} development environment. In this project you will implement a collection of functions using core functionality of PyTorch Tensor objects.


## Instructions

1. <b>Download the project starter code</b>
    - [Project 0 starter code: P0.zip](https://deeprob.org/assets/projects/P0.zip)

2. <b>Unzip the starter code and upload to Google Drive</b>
    - Once unzipped, you should find a root directory titled 'P0'. The 'P0' directory contains all starter code and files needed to complete this project. Please upload the 'P0' directory to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/){:target="_blank"}.

3. <b>Open the `*.ipynb` and `*.py` files and implement features</b>
    - We recommend implementing the features in a Google Colab environment. The Colab development environment can be accessed by double-clicking on each `*.ipynb` and `*.py` file within your Drive. Instructions for each feature are included in the `pytorch101.ipynb` file.

    - While working on the project, keep the following in mind:

        - The notebook and the python file have clearly marked blocks where you are expected to write code. <b>Do not write or modify any code outside of these blocks.</b>
        - <b>Do not add or delete cells from the notebook.</b> You may add new cells to perform scratch computations, but you should delete them before submitting your work.
        - <b>Run all cells, and do not clear out the outputs, before submitting.</b> You will only get credit for code that has been run.
        - To avoid experiencing Colab usage limits, save and close your notebooks once finished working.

<!-- 4. <b>Submit your implementation for Autograder feedback</b>
    - Once you have implemented a portion of the required features, you may submit your work for feedback from the Autograder. To receive feedback, download your `*.ipynb` and `*.py` files then upload them to the [Project 0 Autograder](https://autograder.io/web/project/1882){:target="_blank"}. You may submit to the Autograder for feedback up to 2 times per day. -->

4. <b>Download final implementation</b>
    - After implementing all features, <b>save your work</b> and download the completed `*.ipynb` and `*.py` files. 
    - The last cell of the `pytorch101.ipynb` notebook will generate a `internetid_umid_P0.zip` file (e.g. `kdesingh_1234567_P0.zip`). The zip file should include `pytorch101.ipynb` and `pytorch101.py` for this assignment.

5. <b>Submit your python and notebook files for grading</b>
    - A link will be made available for submitting you code. Watch out for the announcement soon.
    <!-- - Upload your files to the [Autograder](https://autograder.io/web/project/1882){:target="_blank"} for grading consideration. Your highest score will be used for final grades. -->

## Deadline

This project is due on <b>Tuesday, January 24th at 11:59pm CT</b>. We suggest starting as soon as possible.

## Grading

<!-- This project will be graded by the [Autograder](https://autograder.io/web/project/1882){:target="_blank"}.  -->
The project is worth a total of 90 points. 
<!-- You may submit to the Autograder for feedback up to 2 times per day. -->
